# Docker MCP Server Migration - Feature Specification

## Overview
Migrate existing Graphiti MCP server infrastructure to use Docker containers with auto-startup capabilities for macOS development environment. The system must maintain data persistence, support latest stable versions, and provide reliable restart behavior.

## Functional Requirements

### Core Requirements

#### FR-001: Version Management Strategy
- **Requirement**: System must use version ranges that automatically pull latest stable versions without hardcoding specific versions
- **Rationale**: User explicitly requested to avoid version lock-in to enable automatic updates on container rebuilds
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Dependencies specified with minimum version ranges (e.g., `>=0.20.0`)
  - Pre-release versions automatically excluded from selection
  - Container rebuilds pull latest compatible stable versions

#### FR-002: Data Persistence Protection
- **Requirement**: System must never modify or delete user data without explicit permission
- **Rationale**: Critical user data loss occurred due to unauthorized data directory removal
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - All data operations require explicit user consent
  - Data directories are preserved across container restarts
  - Clear warnings before any destructive operations
  - Data integrity verified after system changes

#### FR-003: Enterprise Feature Preservation
- **Requirement**: System must maintain Neo4j Enterprise features including Bloom visualization capabilities
- **Rationale**: User specifically requires Bloom functionality for graph visualization
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Neo4j Enterprise edition with proper license agreement
  - Bloom plugins and procedures enabled
  - Enterprise-specific configurations maintained
  - Memory allocation optimized for Enterprise workloads

#### FR-004: Auto-Startup Reliability
- **Requirement**: Services must automatically start after macOS system restart
- **Rationale**: Development workflow requires services to be available without manual intervention
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - LaunchAgent properly configured for auto-startup
  - Services start in correct dependency order
  - Health checks verify service readiness
  - Startup failures are logged and recoverable

### Network and Connectivity Requirements

#### FR-005: Container Network Isolation
- **Requirement**: Container networking must be properly isolated from host networking
- **Rationale**: Host-based networking caused connection failures in containerized environment
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Services use container service names for internal communication
  - Environment variables properly scoped for container vs. host usage
  - Network configuration clearly separated between development and production

#### FR-006: Configuration Override Protection
- **Requirement**: Container environment variables must not be inadvertently overridden by host configuration
- **Rationale**: Host `.env` files caused container networking to fail
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Container-specific networking takes precedence
  - Clear separation between host and container configuration
  - Environment variable precedence documented and enforced

### Database Management Requirements

#### FR-007: Database State Management
- **Requirement**: Neo4j database must be properly initialized and maintained across restarts
- **Rationale**: Enterprise Neo4j requires explicit database creation and management
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Databases automatically created if missing
  - Database state verified on startup
  - Connection errors provide clear diagnostic information
  - Database availability checked before dependent services start

#### FR-008: Model Configuration Flexibility
- **Requirement**: System must support configurable LLM models while maintaining reasonable defaults
- **Rationale**: Different use cases require different model capabilities and cost profiles
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Primary and secondary model configuration supported
  - Model provider (OpenAI, etc.) clearly identified
  - Configuration changes apply without data loss
  - Model compatibility verified on startup

## User Experience Requirements

### UX-001: Error Communication
- **Requirement**: System failures must provide clear, actionable error messages
- **Rationale**: Technical issues require precise diagnosis for effective troubleshooting
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Error messages include specific component and failure reason
  - Suggested remediation steps provided where possible
  - Log aggregation for multi-service debugging
  - User feedback incorporated into error handling improvements

### UX-002: Change Notification
- **Requirement**: System changes must be communicated clearly with justification
- **Rationale**: Unexpected changes disrupted user workflow and expectations
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Configuration changes explained before implementation
  - User requirements explicitly confirmed before modifications
  - Rollback procedures documented for controversial changes
  - User preferences respected over system defaults

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR-001: Reliability
- Services must achieve 99.9% uptime during development hours
- System must recover automatically from common failure modes
- Data consistency maintained across all restart scenarios

### NFR-002: Performance
- Service startup time under 30 seconds after system boot
- Container resource usage optimized for development workloads
- Network latency between services minimized through proper configuration

### NFR-003: Maintainability
- Configuration changes must be version controlled
- System components must be independently updatable
- Documentation must reflect actual system behavior

## Success Criteria
- User can restart MacBook and have full system available without intervention
- Data persists across all restart scenarios
- Latest stable software versions automatically maintained
- Enterprise features (Bloom) fully functional
- Zero unauthorized data modifications

## Risk Mitigation
- Data backup strategy implemented before any destructive operations
- Configuration validation before service deployment
- Rollback procedures documented for all major changes
- User consent required for any data-affecting operations
